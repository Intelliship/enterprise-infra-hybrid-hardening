# enterprise-infra-hybrid-hardening

This repository simulates a hardened enterprise infrastructure across hybrid environments. It models real-world automation workflows and configuration practices across identity, endpoint management, firewall validation, and escalation response systems.

## Objective

To demonstrate how a Systems Administrator can apply automation to secure and operationalize hybrid enterprise infrastructure using tools like Fortinet, Addigy, Entra ID, and Okta. The goal is to reduce manual overhead, improve visibility, and enforce configuration integrity at scale.

## Use Cases

- Validate firewall integrity across distributed sites using Fortinet
- Automate sync checks between Microsoft Entra ID and Okta
- Run endpoint health audits using MDM platforms like Addigy
- Deploy infrastructure scripts for baseline hardening
- Simulate escalation protocols under a zero trust model
- Structure automation into reusable modules for system lifecycle operations
