# Enterprise Hybrid Infrastructure Hardening

This repository simulates a modular, security-oriented infrastructure model designed to reflect enterprise hybrid environments. It includes scripts and structure for automating identity, compliance, monitoring, and escalation workflows across Windows, macOS, and Linux systems.

## System Purpose

The system demonstrates infrastructure-level automation to validate and enforce device compliance policies. Each file represents a functional layer in the hardening pipeline—from initial identity provisioning to endpoint health verification.

## Key Components

- **MDM Compliance Check**  
  `addigy-mdm-check.sh` simulates macOS MDM enrollment validation using a placeholder Addigy CLI structure.

- **Firewall Rule Validation**  
  `fortinet-firewall-check.ps1` mimics PowerShell-based rule inspection for Fortinet-managed devices.

- **Identity Sync Status**  
  `entra-id-sync-status.ps1` evaluates sync health for Microsoft Entra ID using simulation logic.

- **Escalation Protocol**  
  `zero_trust_escalation_protocol.md` outlines escalation procedures for non-compliant or unmanaged assets.

- **Deployment Orchestration**  
  `deploy_infra_hardening.sh` runs centralized execution of the above components in a unified flow.

## Design Considerations

- Scripts prioritize clarity, modularity, and maintainability—this is a simulation, not production code.
- Directory structure reflects typical enterprise endpoint compliance domains.
- Shell-first execution design can be extended to platforms like Ansible, Jamf, or SCCM.
- Logging conventions are standardized to support visibility and traceability in system monitoring tools.

## Intended Use Cases

- Demonstrating compliance workflows during endpoint onboarding or provisioning.
- Testing shell-based monitoring and policy validation scripts.
- Simulating infrastructure hardening logic for labs, training, or interview prep.
- Structuring DevSecOps pipelines in sandbox or hybrid simulation environments.
